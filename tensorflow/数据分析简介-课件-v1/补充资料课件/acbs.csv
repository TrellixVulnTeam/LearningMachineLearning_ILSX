Distance Learning application deadli",Five to seven years to complete. 14 weeks for one module by distance learning. Three intakes per yea,,"Key Facts				Course Code D4201															Qualification					DAg													Typical Course Length					5 Years				 						Apply Now																	The aim of this Professional Doctorate programme is to produce a qualification which, whilst being equivalent in status and challenge to a PhD, is more appropriate for those pursuing professional rather than academic careers. Our DAg programme comprises taught modules and two work-based research projects, carried out through two-day workshops, distance learning and a mixture of live and virtual supervisory meetings. While the primary academic focus is on the completion of an advanced piece of research, the collaborative route provided by a work-based research project provides an ideal opportunity to embed new knowledge in the work place and ensure that research is relevant to industry. As such, it is crucial that a student??s employer is supportive of both their research aims and the time commitment that the proposed research will involve. Self-employed students should aim to undertake research which will be closely aligned to their business.																		Key Facts											Duration:
Five to seven years to complete. 14 weeks for one module by distance learning. Three intakes per year (January, May, September).
Contact Time:
Part I of the doctoral route comprises three taught modules (including Research Methodology and Advances in Biosciences) followed by a 120 credit dissertation (20,000 words). This part will typically take 2-3 years. Part II is undertaken for a minimum of three years and comprises a longer thesis (up to 60,000 words). It will involve experimentation and must embody the methodology and results of original research. It should, ideally, build upon the Part I dissertation.?
We have designed our training to be as accessible as possible, particularly for those in full time employment. Each taught module comprises a 12 or 14 week distance learning module worth 20 credits which can be taken for your own continuing professional development or interest; or built towards a postgraduate qualification. The research elements of our qualifications are carried out in your work place with regular academic supervision. The training is web-based which means that as long as you have access to a reasonable broadband connection (i.e. are able to stream videos such as on YouTube), you can study where and when best suits you. Learning material includes podcast lectures, e-group projects, guided reading, interactive workbooks and discussion forums, as well as assignments and e-tutorials. By signing a re-registration form each year you will have access to e-journals and library resources for the duration of your registration.
Assessment:
There are no exams within this programme. Taught modules are assessed via course work and forum discussion. Research is monitored and assessed. The viva is an integral part of the examination of the Part II thesis.
Entry Requirements:
Candidates must hold a second class honours degree in agricultural /biological science or a closely related discipline and have at least two years relevant experience in a responsible position in the agri-food sector.
English Language Requirements:
If you have a Bachelor??s degree from a UK University, you do not need to take an English proficiency test.
Non-native English speakers who do not meet this requirement must take a University-recognised test of academic English language proficiency. For further information please see our?English Language requirements page.
 
Course Fees:
Module cost ?S750
Research supervision costs ?S1,950 per year
Fees are required to be paid in full before training commences.
If you are employed full-time within the UK Agri-food sector you may qualify to receive a bursary. Examples of sectors which qualify are: supermarket supply chain advisors, farmers and farm managers, agri-supplies, vets, agri-environmental advisors, agricultural consultants. We regret that teaching staff in HE establishments do NOT qualify for bursaries. Please contact the ATP office for more information. Email:?atp-enquiries@aber.ac.uk

												Overview											The ATP DAg is delivered in two parts:Part I is undertaken for a minimum of two years and comprises two taught modules from the ATP menu*, a taught ??Research Methodology and Advances in Biosciences?? module; and a portfolio of work or a research thesis (approximately 20,000 words in length). Each taught module is worth 20 credits and takes 12 or 14 weeks to complete. The short Part I thesis should involve analysing existing data from the candidate??s workplace. For example: Reviewing historical mineral deficiency data by species and region; analysing and interpreting the findings. Students may exit here with an MRes.?	Part II is undertaken for a minimum of three years and comprises a longer portfolio of work or a research thesis (up to 60,000 words). It will involve experimentation and must embody the methodology and results of original research. It should, ideally, be built upon the Part 1 thesis. Thus, from the example above, could be something like: Changing practices and introducing innovation to combat mineral deficiencies.				Our Staff											The majority of teaching staff at the Institute of Biological, Environmental and Rural Sciences are qualified to PhD level and are research active. Vocational courses also have staff whose background lies within industry.? The Institute has a large number of research only staff with whom students may have contact.

Its aim is to get students to develop their own particular approach to management by establishing a solid foundation of management knowledge and integrating this with their own values, experiences and goals, to provide the basis for a life-long development of their management skills. It is based on a thorough understanding of the theories and practice of management, reinforced by examples of best practice drawn from a wide range of organisations, together with an appreciation of the context and constraints that influence organisations and management. The module will consider the main activities of management from an integrating perspective, together with identifying and developing the qualities required for a successful manager, including leadership. Organisations form the focus of management, consequently the module will develop a sound understanding of the functions, forms, operation and behaviour of organisations in a variety of contexts and situations, together with an appreciation of how all aspects of management are integrated in the management of organisations. Students will examine and critically evaluate examples of good management and bad management, with regard to developing workable solutions that can be applied to management situations and to facilitate the application of management principles and practice to their own field of work.

Have you ever wondered why you can remember an advert from your childhood but haven??t a clue what adverts you saw yesterday? Or maybe you??ve been in a supermarket and wondered why all of the cartoon characters on cereal boxes are looking down. If so you??re probably interested in consumer psychology. Consumer psychology is a specialty area of psychology that studies how feelings, beliefs, and perceptions influence the way consumers buy and relate to goods and services.
This exciting new discipline uses psychological insight and research and applies it to the problems facing markeeters, helping them make better decisions. For example, if a brand is developing a new advertisement, it is essential that it grabs consumers?? attention. Not only should it grab attention, but marketeers will want to ensure that consumers learn the targeted message - and psychologists can help achieve this.? For over a hundred years psychologists have studied concepts including: attention, perception, decision-making learning and motivation to name a few. While these have traditionally been studied in a laboratory based system, the relevance to marketing is obvious. By applying principles generated from learning psychology and our knowledge of how the visual system works, psychologists are able to develop advertisements that are more effective at capturing attention and more likely to be remembered.
Today consumer psychologists are working for some of the largest companies tackling questions ranging from the relatively simple (for example which product packaging grabs the most attention) to the hugely complex (how should the National Health Service use behaviour-changing interventions to reduce waiting times?). In order to help answer these questions techniques used range from traditional focus groups, questionnaires, and crowd-sourced data to the more specialised psychological based approaches including: laboratory experiments, brain imaging and eye tracking.?
This exciting new course will focus on the latest theoretical developments and explain how science is influencing: advertising, branding, consumer decision-making, merchandising, packaging store design and more. This course is perfect for any graduate wishing to start, or further develop a career in Consumer Psychology and Business and is delivered by schools that enjoy an international reputation in their respective fields.
The Teaching Team
Unlike many university courses, which are taught by academics that have no experience outside of academia, all of the teaching team on this course are either practising consumer psychologists, business consultants or both. Over the last ten years, the teaching team has independently worked on projects for companies including: Aldi, Cadburys, Iceland, Kraft, Mars, Tesco, Procter & Gamble, Unilever, Walkers to name a few. The team are also regular contributors to both the BBC and Sky News, featuring on programmes ranging from the Today programme on Radio 4, to Don??t Get Done Get Dom. Not only do the teaching team regularly undertake consultancy work for companies but also a number of staff have permanent positions as scientific advisors for both advertising agencies and shopper research agencies??. Members of the teaching team are active members of both the British Psychological Society (BPS), Society for Consumer Psychology and the Association for Consumer Research. The teaching team is:

Professor James Intriligator,?Professor of Consumer Psychology
Prof Edward Shiu,?Professor of Consumer Psychology
Prof Louise Hassan,?Professor of Consumer Psychology
Professor John Parkinson,?Professor of Motive Neuroscience
Dr. Caroline Bowman,?Senior Lecturer in Consumer Psychology
Mr Stephen Jones, Senior Lecturer in Marketing
Dr Miriam Mehl,?Lecturer in Marketing
Dr Gareth J. Harvey,?Lecturer in Consumer Psychology & Course Director

Facilities
All research students in the Psychology Department have access to a range of state of the art research laboratories, that are used both for teaching Consumer Psychology and when completing dissertation and research projects.? These facilities include:

Three dedicated consumer psychology testing laboratories
Portable Eye-tracking equipment (used for analysing how consumers behave in a retail environment)
Static eye-tracking equipment (used for analysing how consumers interact with webpages)
Facial Tracking equipment: (used for analysing how effective advertisements are at attracting consumers?? attention)
BIOPACs: (A device used to measure participants physiological responses e.g. heart rate, Galvanic Skin Response. For example to assess the psychological impact that advertisements have. ?
A dedicated MRI/fMRI scanner: Used for conducting neuromarketing projects. For example read about a commercial neuormarketing project conducted at Bangor University investigating how consumers react to special offers while shopping here.
Five independent Electrophysiology (EEG) laboratories: Again used for conducting neuromarketing projects, but this is the equipment that the majority of the world??s leading neuromarketing agencies use.

Student Comments and Profiles
""Thank you so much for running such a fantastic course as I think without this I wouldn??t have stood a chance of landing a place on the Ipsos Mori graduate scheme- all the presentations we did definitely helped. I think they loved my passion for brands and consumer-psychology stuff which is down to you and the awesome lectures. The job is?in the ASI department which means I??m looking at consumer opinions of brands and adverts and all stuff like that which is amazing and pretty much exactly one of the things I wanted to do and it will really make use of my Psych stuff and especially my consumer psych stuff.""

Teaching and assessment Teaching At Birkbeck, almost all of our courses are taught in the evening and our teaching is designed to support students who are juggling evening study with work and other daytime commitments. We actively encourage innovative and engaging ways of teaching, to ensure our students have the best learning experience. In the 2017 Teaching Excellence Framework (TEF), the government??s system for rating university teaching, Birkbeck was allocated a Silver award.
Teaching may include formal lectures, seminars, and practical classes and tutorials. Formal lectures are used in most degree programmes to give an overview of a particular field of study. They aim to provide the stimulus and the starting point for deeper exploration of the subject during your own personal reading. Seminars give you the chance to explore a specific aspect of your subject in depth and to discuss and exchange ideas with fellow students. They typically require preparatory study. Our distance-learning and blended-learning courses and modules are self-directed and we will provide you with interactive learning opportunities and encourage you to collaborate and engage via various learning technologies. These courses involve limited or no face-to-face contact between students and module tutors. In addition, you will have access to pastoral support via a named Personal Tutor. Methods of teaching on this course Lectures, laboratory sessions, and coursework completed in your own time. Contact hours On our taught courses, you will have scheduled teaching and study sessions each year. Alongside this, you will also undertake assessment activities and independent learning outside of class. Depending on the modules you take, you may also have additional scheduled academic activities, such as tutorials, dissertation supervision, practical classes, visits and fieldtrips.
On our taught courses, the actual amount of time you spend in the classroom and in contact with your lecturers will depend on your course, the option modules you select and when you undertake your final-year project.
On our distance-learning and blended-learning courses, discussion, collaboration and interaction with your lecturers and fellow students are encouraged and enabled through various learning technologies, but you may have limited or no face-to-face contact with your module tutors. Timetables Timetables are usually available from September onwards and you can access your personalised timetable via your My Birkbeck Profile online (if you have been invited to enrol). Indicative class size Class sizes vary, depending on your course, the module you are undertaking, and the method of teaching. For example, lectures are presented to larger groups, whereas seminars usually consist of small, interactive groups led by a tutor. Independent learning On our taught courses, much of your time outside of class will be spent on self-directed, independent learning, including preparing for classes and following up afterwards. This will usually include, but is not limited to, reading books and journal articles, undertaking research, working on coursework and assignments, and preparing for presentations and assessments.
Independent learning is absolutely vital to your success as a student. Everyone is different, and the study time required varies topic by topic, but, as a guide, expect to schedule up to five hours of self-study for each hour of teaching.
On our distance-learning and blended-learning courses, the emphasis is very much on independent, self-directed learning and you will be expected to manage your own learning, with the support of your module tutors and various learning technologies. Study skills and additional support Birkbeck offers study and learning support to undergraduate and postgraduate students to help them succeed. Our Learning Development Service can help you in the following areas:
academic skills (including planning your workload, research, writing, exam preparation and writing a dissertation)written English (including structure, punctuation and grammar)numerical skills (basic mathematics and statistics).Our Disability and Dyslexia Service can support you if you have additional learning needs resulting from a disability or from dyslexia.
Our Counselling Service can support you if you are struggling with emotional or psychological difficulties during your studies.
Our Mental Health Advisory Service can support you if you are experiencing short- or long-term mental health difficulties during your studies. Assessment Assessment is an integral part of your university studies and usually consists of a combination of coursework and examinations, although this will vary from course to course - on some of our courses, assessment is entirely by coursework. The methods of assessment on this course are specified below under 'Methods of assessment on this course'. You will need to allow time to complete coursework and prepare for exams.
Where a course has unseen written examinations, these may be held termly, but, on the majority of our courses, exams are usually taken in the Summer term, during May to June. Exams may be held at other times of the year as well. In most cases, exams are held during the day on a weekday - if you have daytime commitments, you will need to make arrangements for daytime attendance - but some exams are held in the evening. Exam timetables are published online.

          		Teaching
All students study a common set of modules at all levels to ensure that everyone graduates from the course with the same core knowledge and skills.
How many hours of study are involved?
In Level 1 contact between students and academic staff is relatively high at 17 hours per week. This will assist you in adjusting from school/college to university life. As the course progresses the number of contact hours is steadily reduced as you undertake more project-based work.
How will I be taught?
Lectures
These provide a broad overview of the main concepts and ideas that you need to understand, and give you a framework on which to expand your knowledge by private study.
Laboratories
Practicals are generally three-hour sessions in which you can practice your observational and analytical skills, and develop a deeper understanding of theoretical concepts.
Design studios
In a studio you will work on group projects with guidance from members of staff. You may be required to design and produce an artefact or develop a solution to an engineering problem. These sessions allow you to develop your intellectual ability and practice your teamwork skills.
One-to-one
On registration for the course, you will be allocated a personal tutor whose role is to provide academic and pastoral support during your time at university. You will have one-to-one supervision on all Level 3/4 project work. If you go on an industrial placement you will also be allocated an industrial tutor who will help you to achieve the training objectives necessary to satisfy the requirements for Chartered Engineer status with the Institution of Mechanical Engineers. You will also be visited by a member of the academic staff to monitor the progress of your training.
                    Assessment
Level 1 does not count towards your final degree mark but you have to pass this year to continue with the course. Students wishing to transfer from the BEng to the MEng must achieve at least 60% at Level 2.
Several methods of assessment are employed on the course. There are written examinations at the end of each term, but work is also continuously assessed throughout. You will undertake projects, assignments, essays, laboratory work and short tests.
Project work is commonplace and is usually completed in groups to imitate the everyday experience in an engineering firm, where specialists must pool their talents to design a solution to a problem. In this situation you can develop your management and leadership skills and ensure that all members of the group deliver their best. Group members share the mark gained, so it is up to each individual to get the most out of everyone else.",,"Employability
            	Aviation graduates will leave Brunel with highly marketable knowledge and skills, and will be very well placed to go on to commercial flight training.

Harper Adams University has developed a Masters degree in Poultry Production.
The course
The poultry meat and egg sectors continue to show a consistent growth across all continents, with greater levels of expansion in developing regions of the world. Poultry meat production exceeded 100 milion tons in 2013 with broiler production accounting for all but 10 per cent of this production. With the anticipated expansion in world human population of 9.3 billion primarily in developing countries the demand four poultry meat is expected to continue into the future with India and China representing particularly large markets. Egg production is also expected to continue its expansion. Poultry is a major consumer of animal feed grain, with 40% of the total being used by poultry. There will be competing demands for this feed, which the poultry sector will need to respond to.?
The UK poultry industry is characterised by a small number of large integrated companies a position increasingly mirrored on a global scale. Whilst there is a clear opportunity for growth there are a number of known challenges including feed price volatility in the short to medium term, the increased competition for raw materials in the longer term, poultry health, human health related issues (e.g. Campylobacter), concerns over antibiotic use.
The global poultry sector is particularly well placed to address the needs for increasing quantities of animal derived protein, this programme will provide the platform for students to address these and other emerging issues through focused and tailored assignments allowing students to plot their own pathway of learning.
The programme will serve to offer a portfolio of multidisciplinary topics within a selection of specialised integrative modules to advance students?? understanding of the relevant biosciences underpinning poultry farming. ?This will be presented within a theme of mono-gastric animal production where there are many similarities of principle and scientific approaches.?
In summary the course:

Supports students to develop a level of understanding and knowledge that allows them to work as subject specialists and lead developments within poultry production systems.
Supports students to evaluate the wider consequences of animal production systems, mitigating any detrimental effects on animal welfare, food quality and the natural environment.
Supports students in their development of an advanced understanding of the biological factors that limit animal production and the scientific, technological, economic and social factors that influence animal production systems.

How will it benefit me?
The course will:

Overview
Our Accounting research looks at the relationship between the accounting profession, governance and society and explores the nature and purpose of accounting institutions and practices, with a view to improving social well-being and stimulating greater accountability.
A key part of this is our Accounting Research Centre (ARC) which explores these areas of interest from a variety of perspectives, including Arab and Islamic contexts, historical analysis, gender issues, public sector contexts and interdisciplinary approaches.
ARC's work covers a diverse range of research linked by the common thread of the continuing and significantly growing influential role that accounting plays in the functioning of modern society.

  ?Studying for a postgraduate research degree enhances your employability in a number of ways. 
  As well as enabling you to focus on your specific areas of interest and expand your subject knowledge ready for employment in your chosen sector, a postgraduate research qualification enables you to take charge of your career path by demonstrating your contribution to an area of knowledge. It enhances your self-confidence and showcases your ability to work independently and ??go it alone??.
  According to a report by the Higher Education Statistics Agency (HESA), more than a quarter of graduates felt that their employment prospects were increased by their PG qualification. And when it comes to earnings, those with a postgrad qualification have been shown to earn an average of 24% more than those who leave education with an undergraduate degree.

                

                
                    
  ?Some postgraduate research students are already in full time employment when they begin their studies, whilst others are recent graduates looking to extend their research capabilities and subject expertise.
  A good proportion of our students return to their existing roles with enhanced career prospects, others move on to further study or take up teaching roles in universities and other educational establishments.

Crime and Offender Patterns
(core,
20 credits)

??




This module currently runs:


spring semester
- Wednesday



This module allows students to identify and critically assess patterns in specific forms of crime and offending behaviour, as well as to consider the prevalence, characteristics and typologies of specific types of offence. Models used to explain crime and offender patterns, as well as recidivism and desistance, will be considered. These will be related to the wider theoretical criminological field.To begin with, the module is structured around identifying and evaluating key patterns and characteristics of recorded crime and offending behaviour, with a particular (but not exclusive) emphasis on the UK. The module also aims to present and assess explanatory models used to explicate crime trends, and changes in offending patterns.The module then focuses on specific types of offence category (including violent and sexual offences, financial, organised crime and environmental crime), and identifies specific trends. As a corollary, the escalation of offending behaviour and the concept of criminal 'career' is evaluated.The third and final element of the module centres on an analysis of 'serial offenders', and the ways in which offender and geographic profiling might (or might not) assist in understanding and detecting such offenders.

Criminological Research Methods
(core,
20 credits)

??




This module currently runs:


spring semester
- Wednesday
morning



The module seeks to provide a good grounding in the understanding and appreciation of criminological research methods. Students will be taken through the process of conducting social research from the formulation of a research question through to the completion of a [quantitative] research report. Students will learn about designing social research, data collection and analysis in a clear and accessible way. The module will enable students to determine which research methodology to apply as part of the research process. Students on this module will benefit from the experience of ??guest?? lectures from academics with experience of conducting primary research within the field of criminology/criminal justice. Guest speakers will include, for example, University-based or Home Office researchers or those based in particular criminal justice agencies. These lectures/workshop sessions are designed to help students understand the practicalities and challenges of conducting research in the 'real world'. Students will receive tuition on quantitative data collection and analysis with a particular emphasis on the use of SPSS. During their engagement with the module, students will also be expected to make the appropriate level of reference to standard texts in research methods; this will assist in the evaluation of specific research studies, which forms a key component of the module. The module commences by providing an overview of the principal approaches in social research.

Crime, Risk and Early Intervention
(option,
20 credits)

??




This module currently runs:


spring semester
- Wednesday
afternoon



The module aims to explore what is known about children and young people at risk of offending, and what is known about the childhoods of adults dealt with in the criminal justice system, to understand what interventions might have reduced risk. It also considers the social disadvantages and environmental context which contribute to risk, leading to a comparison of targeted versus universal strategies of prevention. The second part of the programme is then on ??what works?? in early intervention.

Green Criminology
(option,
20 credits)

??




This module currently runs:


spring semester
- Tuesday
morning



The module aims to explore what is meant by the term 'Green Criminology'. In its broadest sense, it refers to the study of harms committed against the environment by corporations, states and also ordinary people. A growing realisation that the health of this planet is intricately linked to the health of each one of us, has led to the development of a multi-disciplinary approach within Criminology incorporating a number of theoretical and philosophical perspectives. The module will therefore make use of a wide range of contributions from Human Geography, Philosophy, Political Science, Sociology and others in order to link together and further our understanding of the complex nature of environmental harms and crimes in particular and criminogenic systems in general.

?",assessment,"Bernado Jurema
MSc Comparative Politics, 2011Research Associate, Freie Universit?t Berlin

I initially chose the LSE for academic purposes, because it is such a respected institution and also because of the programme of my degree. I soon came to realise that this was only part of it. Living in London, with all that it has to offer, was just as, if not more, important. It opened doors and new opportunities that I would never have had elsewhere.?I would encourage students to take advantage of the fact that you are in London. Most organisations, NGOs, think-tanks and so on have some sort of office or representation there. And the LSE ??label?? helps immensely, so make use of it.?
I am thankful for my time at the LSE. I have learned a great deal, both in terms of content as well as in research skills. It broadened my horizons, it greatly extended my network connections and I made great friends with whom I keep in contact to this day.

I chose LSE to have some credibility as a person passionate about political science. I chose my degree in Comparative Politics, Politics and Market stream, because I am very curious to analyse and understand the relationships between the state and the market and assess how it can be improved for more justice and sustainability.?It was definitely the best year of my whole life because I learnt so much. Despite the fact that it was stressful, intense and scary when I used to think about the final exams, I miss it so much now and I wish I could go back.",,2:1 degree or equivalent in any discipline,chinese_requirements,ATAS,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,N/A,N/A,LSAT,MCAT,,,,,"Every graduate student is charged a fee for their programme.

Assessment is the process of evaluating or assessing your learning.

Sometimes it will involve consideration of work in progress, while at others it concentrates on work which you have completed and submitted as assessment requirements for each unit of study.

The University assesses you through the coursework that you produce as you complete each unit. Each unit will require that you present a portfolio of work which may include finished pieces of work, written work, your research, and a reflective journal which allows you to evaluate your learning and highlight your strengths and areas for further development.

There are two types of assessment that you will receive while on your course:

Formative assessment is the process whereby your work and progress are assessed at regular intervals with accompanying feedback from staff in order to help to improve your performance. Staff will provide you with feedback on the progress of your work before you reach the assessment point at the end of the unit. This may take place one-to-one with a tutor (eg in a tutorial) or in group sessions.
Summative assessment is the process whereby your work is evaluated and given a mark at the end of course unit. Summative assessment formally records your achievement of the unit??s learning outcomes.
You will be assessed against the approved unit learning outcomes and assessment requirements as outlined in Unit Outlines and Project Briefs which you can find in the Course Guide. Project Briefs guide you through the specific areas of work in which you will be engaged in order to produce the work required for assessment and so successfully achieve the unit learning outcomes. Further information about assessment can be found in the Course Guide which is available on the relevant Course Guide.

Many courses also employ self and peer evaluation or assessment within their overall assessment processes. Self-evaluation and self-assessment require you to reflect upon your learning and performance and to submit this to tutors. Peer evaluation and peer assessment are used when students have been working in teams and require each team member to reflect upon their peers?? performance and to submit this to tutors.

FEEDBACK FOLLOWING ASSESSMENT
Formative assessment is itself a process of feedback on your progress. You are also given feedback on your performance following each summative assessment. This is delivered in accordance with your unit outline and with reference to the NUA Student Agreement and NUA Feedback to Students Policy. Feedback on assessment performance will be given to you in a written report with opportunities to meet your tutor for further discussion.","ASSESSMENT

Accounting involves the recording, reporting and communication of financial information about a business to help managers, investors and other stakeholders make appropriate decisions. Modern economics integrates a wide range of major topics from decisions that consumers make to strategic decisions that firms make and the impact of government polices on market outcomes. Studying these broad topics enables you to develop a set of analytical tools that can be applied to a broad range of problems.This course is aimed at students seeking a career in either accounting or economics. As well as developing technical accounting and economics knowledge, you also gain vital numerical, decision-making and communication skills to understand and explain financial and economic information. You learn using case studies and real world information that enable you to apply your learning to real-world situations.The core modules help you develop the academic skills required by both accountants and economists, such as financial accounting, management accounting, microeconomics, and macroeconomics.

                About the course
                Fascinated by the science of sound? Southampton Solent University's undergraduate acoustics programme will see you working under an expert academic team and using industry-standard acoustics facilities. You??ll explore the nature of sound, vibration and the way they interact, developing a wide-ranging knowledge of acoustics engineering.
            
            
                Acoustics covers all aspects of sound and its behaviour, and therefore acousticians are an essential element for everything from designing the latest concert venues to reducing aircraft noise emissions or making the latest vacuum cleaner quieter.
This highly practical course aims to help students develop an in-depth knowledge of the theory and practice of acoustics, alongside core engineering skills such as computer programming, signal processing and electronics. During their studies, students can also learn to use the latest measurement, simulation and modelling technology.
To aid study and help perfect their technique, students have access to the University??s fully-equipped laboratory and studio facilities. Students will be able to utilise industry-standard packages for acoustic measurement and laboratory work using a wide range of test equipment such as sound level meters, a 16-channel data acquisition system, head and torso simulators, a laser vibrometer and ambisonic microphones. Students will also have access to cutting-edge simulation and modelling software, including MATLAB, NI Labview, CadnaA, CATT Acoustic, and EASE.
The dedicated electronics labs are used for systems testing and circuit building and students will also have access to specialist facilities for the testing and demonstration of acoustic and electro-acoustic principles, including a hemi-anechoic chamber, audio isolation booths for sound recording and audiometric testing, and the University??s digital 3D cinema.

The structure of the suite of pathways is such that you can delay choice between these four programmes until the second-year of study in the BSc Hons Accounting (Pathways). This flexibility provides you with the opportunity to experience subject areas, before making a choice between maintaining your specialism in accounting or broadening your interest to financial economics/management.Year 1: Subject areas including financial mathematics and statistics, financial accounting, management accounting and economics, are to establish the academic foundation for the second year of the programme with a professional skills-based module equipping you with the necessary academic and managerial awareness to enhance your learning and employability. The first-year of the programme is designed to help you make a choice of pathway through providing opportunities to experience each pathway area.Year 2: In the second-year you will take four modules which develop knowledge and skills in the accounting subject including law, financial accounting, management accounting and personal and business finance. In second year, a career entrepreneurship module will further develop key communication skills and soft skills to enhance professional development and enterprise skills. The sixth module studied will be dependent on your chosen pathway. Students on the BSc Hons Accounting and BSc Hons Accounting (Forensic Services) pathways will complete a module on assurance and risk management. Students on the BSc Hons Accounting (Financial Economics) will complete a module on money and the economy and on the BSc Hons Accounting (Management Consulting) pathway a module on managing people.Year 3: You will have the option of a paid placement year in a range of local and international locations.

The standards of degrees and awards are safeguarded by distinguished external examiners ? senior academic staff from other universities in the UK ? who approve and moderate assessed work.High calibre staffMost of our academic staff teach for three terms out of four, with the remaining term used for research. Because of this, we have no difficulty in attracting high calibre, highly respected lecturers, many of whom also have a background in business or industry and can offer networking opportunities for students. Find out more about the Medical School faculty.Teaching methodsDedicated teaching fellows and specialist registrars assist course directors and external consultants, many of national and international eminence.The teaching is clinically-oriented and delivered on the medical wards, out-patients, Accident & Emergency department and in the ITU. This is complemented by theory lectures provided by leading consultants in their speciality. Candidates also attend regular radiology and multidisciplinary meetings, hospital grand rounds, and hospital junior doctor teaching sessions.All students are permitted to take histories from patients and conduct clinical examinations, whether or not they have registration with the GMC. However, those candidates who pass the PLAB test and thereby obtain registration with the GMC, or those who are awarded sponsored registration, will be allowed to perform practical procedures on actual patients under supervision. Candidates without GMC registration can only observe such practical procedures on real patients.Visit the Medical School timetable for more information on the teaching schedule.Assessment methodsExaminations, in the form of Objective Structured Clinical Examinations (OSCEs), are held at the end of each 10 week term and involve the participation of an external examiner.Candidates must achieve a score of at least 50% in all 8 courses to be eligible for the award of Clinical MD.The General Internal Medicine module is assessed by written exam (30%), clinical audit (10%) and dissertation on a clinical topic (60%).Library facilitiesThe postgraduate centre at Ealing Hospital has a well-resourced medical library with computing facilities. This is available to students at all times.Practical proceduresAll candidates can take histories from patients and perform clinical examinations irrespective of GMC registration.All candidates, with or without GMC registration, are taught hands-on clinical procedures on models and mannequins in a fully equipped skills laboratory in the hospital. This may include, for example, hands on training in inserting vascular lines (central and arterial), lumbar punctures, pleural tap and biopsy etc. It may also be possible for candidates to gain practical experience in endoscopic procedures in the skills laboratory, especially GI endoscopy and fibreoptic bronchoscopy.However, those candidates who pass the PLAB test and obtain registration with the General Medical Council, or who have obtained full GMC registration by sponsorship, are allowed to perform practical procedures on patients under supervision. Candidates without GMC registration can only observe such practical procedures on patients without actually performing them or assisting in their performance.",assessment,"It is anticipated that following successful completion of the programme students will return to their home countries. Those participants who obtain registration with the GMC by passing the PLAB test during their stay in the UK, or obtaining sponsored registration, may well be eligible to enter further postgraduate training or a service post (staff grade, trust grade, research and teaching fellow) with the possibility of making a long term career in medicine in the UK.

                    Making your application
Applications should be made online directly to the university - visit our website or contact enquirycentre@cumbria.ac.uk for details and guidance. There is no official closing date but we would encourage you to apply as early as possible, as many courses are competitive.
What makes a good application?
We consider all aspects of your application, not simply your qualifications and grades. We look at your academic background and performance, relevant experience (particularly for professional courses where some voluntary or paid experience is required) and your reference. Above all, we look for motivation, commitment and potential - evidence that you can benefit from study at higher education level.
Make sure you include:

Relevant qualifications/evidence of ability: check our website for the specific entry requirements required for each course. Tell us your previous academic results and your projected grades.
A supportive reference, from an employer or your school or college.
A good personal statement.

Explain clearly what attracts you to the course and tell us about your wider interests and experience. If you are applying for a course that incorporates professional training and placements, you should include any relevant experience or visits you have made in the workplace. Highlight your individual strengths and qualities, personal skills, capacity for teamwork, contribution to the community and your enterprise, originality and determination. Select some activities which bring out these qualities.
What next?
When we receive your application, we will send you an acknowledgement and if you are successful at this stage you will get either - an offer (with an invitation to visit the campus to which you have applied), or - an invitation to interview on a particular date. If we are not able to offer you a place on your chosen course we will usually try to offer you a place on a similar course and will contact you to discuss this. Alternatively, if we think you are suitable, but cannot offer you a place on your preferred campus because of the level of competition, we will offer you a place at another campus if one is available.
And if I accept?
The admissions team will contact you and send further information from February onwards about accommodation, and from May/June onwards about preparing to join the university. If you have any other queries, please telephone the admissions offices for information and advice on 0845 6061144.
Deferred entry
We welcome applications for deferred entry on some courses. If you have specific plans during your year out, indicate these on your personal statement as they may be relevant to your course and could enhance your application.
International students
Please see the international pages of our website for full details of our entry requirements (including English-language skills) as well as contacts for advice and support.
From 2009 the UK Border Agency introduced a Points-Based Immigration System (PBS) for students coming to the UK from outside the European Economic Area (EEA).
Students entering higher education will need to obtain a Confirmation of Acceptance (CAS) plus finance confirmation to obtain a Tier 4 student visa.
UK education providers are licensed by the UK Border Agency. When students apply for their visa (or entry clearance) they will need a valid Certificate of Acceptance of Studies from the university. Please note that a CAS is not a guarantee that a visa will be issued.

  2 August 2018",2018/9/1,,"This programme is a comprehensive and intensive investigation into key areas in accounting and finance. Designed for those with a quantitative background, it is both academically rigorous and closely in line with professional practice.

The MSc in Accounting and Finance is especially useful for those graduates with work experience in accounting looking to gain essential practical skills in finance - and, of course, vice versa. Although the compulsory core courses ensure a good balance between both accounting and finance study, the option courses give students the opportunity to specialise - tailoring their studies towards their chosen career.

Studying accounting and finance in Edinburgh gives students the opportunity to base themselves at the heart of the UK's second largest financial centre.

Many of Europe's leading financial institutions have their headquarters here, a fact that we make full use of on the MSc programme. We regularly bring guest speakers to the School to talk directly to accounting and finance students on real, current practice. The School also maintains good relationships with a number of accounting and finance professionals who will be on hand to provide advice on research and career opportunities.

In second year, all students take modules that extend and refine their knowledge of Latin literature and its background, covering prose and poetry both from the Republic and from the imperial period, while continuing to incorporate progressive work on Latin language skills in preparation for Honours-level study.
The skills you gain in analysing original Latin texts will prepare you to explore an even wider range of texts at a more advanced level in your third and fourth years. You will also be encouraged to delve deeper into a specialist topic of your choice in writing a dissertation during your fourth year. All of the School??s Honours modules are inspired by the research expertise of the members of staff who teach them, and expose you to the latest debates and developments in the discipline. They cover a wide range of genres and themes. Topics may include:

Latin prose writing, including philosophical writing, oratory, letter writing and biography
Latin poetry, including didactic poetry, lyric, satire and epic
Late antique Latin literature
Latin prose composition
Renaissance reception of Latin literature.

A wide choice of other modules is available to complement Latin and suit your interests: popular choices include Classical Studies, Ancient History, English Literature, Modern Languages, Medieval and Modern History, Philosophy and Divinity.
Students wishing to study both Greek and Latin should choose the Classics MA programme.

As a Doctor of Applied Social Research student in?the Faculty of Social Sciences you will follow a?programme of study that will allow you to develop your?skills as a researcher before working with experienced?supervisors on the conduct of an original piece of?research.
Our Professional Doctorate programme is?very flexible - you are able to take a tailored pathway?through your studies. Currently there are six professional?pathways: Housing; Social Work; Dementia Studies;?Drug and Alcohol Studies; Criminal Justice?and Social Research.
In the taught components of the?programme, each route allows you to work together?with other professionals to build key research skills while?also deepening your professional development through?a range of specialist options. You will then complete an?assignment based on a professional project within the?workplace. This will connect your research skills and?real-world experience, encouraging you to engage
reflexively at an advanced level over your professional?role and practice. The thesis then provides an opportunity?for advanced research on a topic of your choice.
The Professional Doctorate programme is open to?experienced executives or professionals.
The award of Doctor of Applied Social Research is?equivalent to a PhD.
Doctoral students will demonstrate scholarship,?methodological expertise, a contribution to?knowledge about practice and a contribution to practice.
Directed study for the Professional Doctorate is on a?part-time basis over two or three years, followed by?the Thesis.

The programme is designed to change the way you think as a professional. It is expected that you will be able to make a significant difference to your professional environment from the very beginning of the programme. Ideas and methods from a range of disciplines will be applied to your own fields of expertise. Candidates on all Professional Doctorate pathways work together on a range of ??core?? research modules:
Core modules
ASRP002:?Research Design and Process
20 credits, SCQF 11
The module takes students through the process of designing a research project. It enables them to think up an interesting research idea, to carry out a literature review, identify appropriate theoretical frameworks, refine the research question and then work out which methods to use. It introduces students to some of the more common research strategies and methods. It invites reflection on the ethics and politics of the research process, and encourages students to think systematically about dissemination of findings, knowledge exchange and research impact. The assessment for the module reinforces what has been learned: it involves thinking up a research topic, refining it into some researchable questions and then writing a proposal for funding.
ASRP003:?Introduction to Information Technology and Library Services
No credits given
The module is designed to make you aware of resources concerning Information Technology and Library Services; make you comfortable in the application of certain core IT and Library skills and aware of how to go about extending your knowledge of and confidence in further IT applications and Library Services.
ASRP004:?Quantitative Data Analysis
20 credits, SCQF 11
The module introduces quantitative data analysis, covering a selection of those statistical techniques which are most commonly employed in social science research. It also covers practical training in the application of quantitative methods to social science data. The emphasis will be on the analysis of data collected in social surveys, particularly the secondary analysis of large scale surveys.
ASRP001:?The Nature of Social Enquiry
20 credits, SCQF 11
This module aims to introduce students to the theoretical foundations that underpin social scientific research and analysis. The module begins by examining the main themes and issues within the philosophy of science and social science and then investigates different classical and modern theoretical perspectives for exploring the social world.
ASRP005:?Qualitative Data Analysis
20 credits, SCQF 11
This module introduces students to qualitative data analysis. It aims to provide them with understanding and experience of conducting the analysis of qualitative data (including visual data), as well as a critical awareness of the role of computer assisted qualitative data analysis software (CAQDAS). Students will demonstrate the ability to conduct secondary analysis on a qualitative dataset and a critical appreciation of the impact of analysing secondary as well as primary data.
ASRP020:?Professional Practice Research
60 credits, SCQF 12
This module aims to provide students with the ability and insights to reflect on their place and role as a professional within situated and wider communities of practice. With supervision, students are encouraged to use and develop their accumulated research skills and theoretical, epistemological and ontological knowledge to engage in an exploration of their own practice. In examining these issues, the module therefore aims to configure students?? relationship between practice, practice development and academic enquiry.
ASRP011:?Thesis
360 credits, SCQF 12
Following completion of the taught modules, you progress to the empirical research stage and ultimately construct a thesis of approximately 45,000 words on a topic that will enhance the knowledge base in your field of practice.
Optional Modules
Thie core modules give the opportunity both to build high-quality research skills and to learn from each other??s experiences as professionals. Each professional pathway then offers a choice of modules from which two may be selected to tailor your own programme. (See 'Pathways' above).
The aim is to bring you up to date with the latest ideas, findings and methods, challenging assumptions and changing how you as a professional think about the relationship between research, scholarship and expertise. You will be encouraged to look at new ideas about systems, how decisions are made and how to design the professional environment so that you can see, understand, evaluate, plan and take action with maximum speed and efficiency.",N/A,"??38,030","Structure and teaching
Delivery and assessment
Teaching methods are adapted to suit the aims of each module, and include lectures, seminars, computer-based workshops and group work.

As part of the respective project development, we interrogate the agency of a piece of work and its relationship with the viewer, in a post-documentary environment, alongside thinking about non-representational strategies in installation.We encourage students to work experimentally and produce work that tests the boundaries of the medium, encompassing the still image, video, installation, performance and digital media, and culminating in a public exhibition.The Media School offers a longstanding tradition of photography education with a highly regarded research culture, and the course has close ties with the Photography and the Archive Research Centre and The Stanley Kubrick Archive, both based at LCC. Located close to central London, the course has excellent links with galleries, museums and archives.MA Photography attracts a broad range of practitioners, from backgrounds in fine art photography, documentary photography, commercial photography and other areas of media practice.

                        ","This degree offers a tightly integrated programme with a selection of modules that will enrich your research methods and approaches in the American Studies subject-area. Whilst concentrating on the core aspects of American Studies you will be encouraged to pursue your research through avenues of related subjects (History, Literature and Film) forming a holistic, yet inter-disciplinary, approach. The modules offered emphasise a cross-fertilisation of subject areas, promoting an international perspective towards America, such as global concerns and transnational considerations, thus shifting from the original constructs of America, ??American uniqueness?? and ??exceptionalism?? (Brian Edwards, Globalising American Studies, 2010).This programme is, therefore, well-suited to those students who prefer diversity to the narrower focus of a single-subject Master??s degree.The suite of taught modules have been carefully constructed to take you on a series of journeys - from a discussion of American Studies itself as an approach, and then from the immediate localities, regions and borders of the United States, to the wider national and international settings.
